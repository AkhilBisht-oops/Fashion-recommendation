# fashion-recommendation-system

👗 **Image-Based Fashion Recommendation System**  
A deep learning–powered fashion recommender that suggests visually similar clothing items using CNN image embeddings and cosine similarity. Built with **PyTorch**, **Scikit-learn**, and **Streamlit** for fast, interactive recommendations.

## 🧠 About the Project

This project analyzes fashion product images and recommends similar items based on visual appearance. A pretrained **ResNet** model is used to extract deep image features, and **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** with cosine similarity is applied to find the most relevant recommendations.

The goal of this project is to explore **computer vision in recommender systems** and build a simple yet effective real-world fashion recommendation application.
